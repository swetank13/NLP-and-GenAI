    "  - Hugging Face, LLM APIs, Langchain – used to build state-of-the-art, modern NLP and Gen AI applications.\n",
    "  - Spacy, Gensim – used to build classical NLP applications with low latency pipelines.\n",
    "  - NLTK – mainly used in research, teaching, and experimentation.\n",
    "  - Above are loose guidelines. Many industrial NLP applications use multiple of these tools in a single application.\n",
    "- Spacy\n",
    "  - Provides most efficient NLP algorithm for a given task. Hence if you care about the end result, go with Spacy.\n",
    "  - It is object oriented.\n",
    "  - It is user friendly.\n",
    "  - Perfect for app developer.\n",
    "  - It is a new library and has very active user community. "

    "- Pre-Processing stage\n",
    "  - Sentense Tokenization -> Word Tokenization -> Stop word removal -> Stemming, Lemmatization\n",
    "- Tokenization is the foundational step in NLP, breaking down text into smaller, processable units.\n",
    "- Word tokenization splits text into words, making it simple but prone to out-of-vocabulary issues.\n",
    "- Character tokenization breaks text into individual characters, providing flexibility for unknown words.\n",
    "- Subword tokenization efficiently handles rare words by splitting them into frequently used sub-parts.\n",
    "- Subword tokenization is a popular approach used by models such as BERT, GPT, etc., due to the advantages it offers.\n",
    "##### Tokenization in Spacy\n",
    "- spacy.blank(\"en\") is used to create a blank language object. Using this we can tokenize a sentence.\n",
    "- Tokens in Spacy have attributes such as like_num, is_currency, is_alpha, etc., that help identify the type of token.\n",
    "- Spacy provides support for defining custom tokenizers."
